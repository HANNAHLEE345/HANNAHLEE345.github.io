# Practice

**Welcome**

This is a Practice wbstie. 

**Coffee**
![Tell me your story](assets/img/sutar-1749303.jpg) My favorite thing about coffee is the smell.

Why these changes do not show on the page? 

I could make menu on the left side. But I am still struggling with separating them by rows and showing its contents on the right side when clicking the menu. Let's try to find code sources. 

This still does not update...

Okay, now the page is working as I want it to work. 
It has menu tap on the left side and the contents are on the right side. 
Maybe it updates really slow? But why? 

There needs to be both layouts **html file** and posts **md file**. 

Also I want to remove **"View My GitHub Profile"** link on the tab menu.

# Practice

**Welcome**

This is a Practice website. 

**Coffee**
![Tell me your story](assets/img/sutar-1749303.jpg) My favorite thing about coffee is the smell.  


**1st Update**

These changes do not show on the page...?

I could make menu on the left side. But I am still struggling with separating them by rows and showing its contents on the right side when clicking the menu. Let's try to find code sources. 

This still does not update...
